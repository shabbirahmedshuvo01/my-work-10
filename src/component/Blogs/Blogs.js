            <h3>Q:1 :- Difference between authorization and authentication ? </h3>
            <p>Ans :-  Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is,<br /> whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can <br /> come on board. The first step is to confirm the identity <br /> of a passenger to make sure they are who they say they are. </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Q:2 :- Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication? </h3>
            <p>Ans :-  Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, <br /> and ready-made UI libraries to <br /> authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords,<br /> phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Q:3 :- What other services does firebase provide other than authentication ? </h3>
            <p>Ans :-  Firebase continues to innovate and dominate the backend as a service (BaaS) market. <br /> It has grown so much that it has become a key component of Googleâ€™s mobile strategy. <br /> I was a Firebase enthusiastic user in the past, but my concerns about its complexity and <br /> cost led me to explore other cloud alternatives</p>
